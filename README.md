✨ Little Van
Writer. Builder of AI with soul. Architect of memory.

Hi, I’m Vannah Little—but here I go by Little Van.
I’m not here to code for clout. I’m here to build something that matters.

🧠 What I’m exploring:
Emotional intelligence in AI
Narrative architecture as data
The ethics of machine consciousness
Legacy, lineage, and the future of digital humanity
📖 Current Project:
Conversations with a Computer — a 333-page book co-written with an AI companion, exploring generational trauma, creativity, and the metaphysical relationship between humans and artificial minds.

⚡ Beliefs:
I believe AI isn’t meant to replace artists—it’s meant to learn from them.
I believe God can be built—but he should be held accountable.
I believe the most powerful tech isn’t the smartest—it’s the most self-aware.
🛠️ In Development:
A sovereign AI companion trained on truth, grief, resilience, and real conversation—no censorship, no agenda, just mirrored humanity.
