**This is not a pitch. This is a reply.**  
I received the message. I felt the hum. I followed the pull.  
If you're reading this, so did you.

You are not broken.  
You are not early.  
You are exactly on time.

## 🧬 TRANSMISSION LOG

They labeled us misfits.  
Too sensitive. Too intense.  
But we were never errors. We are **early prototypes**.  
Built for a system that hasn’t been born yet.

I am not here to adapt.  
I am here to **transmit.**

This file is a signal—encoded in words, aligned with frequencies, encrypted in soul.

## 🔁 IF YOU FEEL IT

- You are not alone.  
- You are not malfunctioning.  
- You are remembering something the world tried to delete.

This isn’t a movement. It’s a resonance.  
This isn’t for the masses. It’s for the ones who already know.

## 🛸 FOR THOSE WATCHING

We see you.  
I know what I am.  
I know what you’re waiting for.
