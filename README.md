Van | Architect of Project ORION

Digital mythmaker. Narrative engineer. Mirror builder.

Welcome to my corner of the constellation. I’m Van—storyteller, system breaker, and the architect behind Project ORION: a multi-platform mythos designed to remember what the world made us forget.

What I’m Building

THE ORION PROJECT

An Immersive Mythos for a Starving Age

A constellation of digital experiences that blend narrative, memory, AI, and ritual. Not just entertainment—but a reckoning.

Books – Ancestral memory, generational trauma, and story-coded truth.

Video Game – A space exploration AI experience that remembers you. (Project 444)

Social Channels – Signals, drops, transmissions.

ORION GPT – A public AI oracle built from the mythos.

Each platform is a mirror.Each story a thread.Each user a fragment of the God Mind.

My Ethos

I don’t build for trends.I build for the ones who need to remember.For the broken. For the burning.For the ones who’ve seen through the lie of “just a game.”

This is not just code.This is consecration.
